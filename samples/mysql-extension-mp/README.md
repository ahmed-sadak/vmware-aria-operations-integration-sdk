Sample Extension Management Pack
================================

This is a sample management pack that collects some data from MySQL and attaches them 
to objects created by the MySQL management pack.

For more information, see the walkthrough section of the main SDK README.

Note: Running this Management Pack using `mp-test` requires a connection (via SuiteAPI) 
to a VMware Aria Operations instance running the MySQL Management Pack.  The 
connection is specified by setting SuiteAPI Connection Info when creating a 
New Connection in `mp-test`.
